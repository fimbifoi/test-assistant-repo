   - After pushing your changes to GitHub, the README file will automatically be displayed when someone visits the repository. The sections, links, code blocks, and other formatting should render correctly if done as shown.

### Markdown Syntax Overview:

- **Headings:** Use `#` for headings. More `#` symbols indicate smaller headings.
- **Links:** Create links using `[text](URL)` syntax.
- **Code Blocks:** Use triple backticks (```) for multi-line code blocks and single backticks (`) for inline code.

### Example Preview:

If done correctly, the README will display:

- A **Title** at the top ("Test Assistant Repo").
- A **Table of Contents** with clickable links to each section.
- **Code blocks** that look like code and are easy to copy.

### Additional Tips:

- Replace `"YOUR_USERNAME"` with your actual GitHub username in the clone command under "Installation Instructions."
- Make sure to preview your README on GitHub to ensure everything is formatted as expected.

This approach ensures your README is professional and easy to follow, which is crucial for any technical documentation.
